                The holiday of a life time - our gulet adventure in the Dodecanese Greek Islands was without a doubt our
                favourite family trip. The comfort and beauty of the gulet, the incredibly caring crew, the delicious
                food, the history we learned from our competent and friendly leader, along with the stunning beauty of
                the islands. Swimming in the most gorgeous coves, kayaking on crystal blue waters, hiking around ruins
                and into small remote villages and relaxing on the boat... it was the

                We had the most remarkable family tour with Peter Sommer Travels. Not only everything was perfect, but
                we felt, in every instance, that our guides and our gulet crew truly cared about us, both the kids and
                adults, and did their best to make this trip memorable. For our well-traveled children (aged 9 and 6)
                this definitely has become the most eye-opening, adventurous, and stunning journey of their life -
                something they will remember, draw upon, and cherish for many years to come. For adults, we were
                pleasantly surprised by the diversity of our trip: from neolithic archaeological sites to medieval
                castles, from swimming to get obsidian to talks on board of our wonderful gulet, from ever-changing and
                filled with surprises meals offered on board to culinary experiences on the shore, every island and
                every new activity offered new experiences. We definitely will be back!

                What a wonderful experience! The two tour leaders who were archaeologists enthralled us with the history
                of the Islands. The food was bountiful. On the boat the meals were wholesome and delicious. We were
                treated to wonderful meals on the the Islands that let us sample each Island's speciality. There was
                free time on each of the Islands that allowed for shopping, exploring or sitting round watching island
                life sipping a drink! The accommodation on the gulet was more than adequate with rooms being serviced
                everyday. There was ample deck space to lounge, reading or talking. The staff on the Gulet were lovely
                and attentive. Excellent.

                Our gulet cruise in Greece from Kos to Patmos was everything and more than expected. It lived up to the
                Peter Sommer Travels' emphasis on culture, history, archaeology, comfort and camaraderie. Exceptional
                guides attended to each guest's interests and needs and were exceptional hosts. Very enjoyable were
                swimming in secluded bays, the wonderful food quality and selection and the sites visited on each
                island. It was all one could hope for and a strong inducement to do another PST adventure very soon.
